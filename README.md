# I-Sought-I-Found-Web

This is a website that I made for my final project in my Web1 Class, which focused on HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. 

It is my own version of Max Erickson's website, isoughtifound.com.
He runs a Christian Campus Ministry for our Hockey team at Saint Mary's University of MN.

Thank you for checking it out!

DIRECTIONS TO VIEW WEBSITE: 

1. Click on the green "Code" button on the right-hand side of the screen and select "Download ZIP" to download a compressed copy of the website.

2. Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, extract the contents to a folder of your choice. (Press Extract All for Windows)

3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files and locate the index.html file.

4. Double-click on the index.html file to open it in the default web browser or browser of choice. This will open the web app in the browser.
