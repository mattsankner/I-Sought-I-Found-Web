# I-Sought-I-Found-Web

This is a website that I made for my final project in my Web1 Class, which focused on HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. 

It is my own version of my good friend and mentor's website (Max Erickson, isoughtifound.com).
He runs a Christian Campus Ministry for our Hockey team at Saint Mary's University of MN.

Thank you for checking it out!
